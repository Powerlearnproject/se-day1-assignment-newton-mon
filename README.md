Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

`Software Engineering is the process of applying Engineering methodology in the development of Software &/Software Products. The activities involved can include code generation, and creating solutions by software. Software Engineering provides a standardized method for defining, designing developing and maintaining software which is neccesary for most computerised aspects in the technology industry.`


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
`Development of programming languages - like C, Python ,Java has provided flexibility of different applications 
the establishment & recognition of software engineering as a discipline 
the advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s'`


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

 `Requirements: identifying user needs and system requirements.
 Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
 Implementation: Code Generation and building the software according to the design specifications.
 Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
 Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
 Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.`


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

`'Waterfall: A development methodology that uses a Sequential approach in development. one stage follows another. i.e Construction process.
Agile: Iterative and incremental development approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change i.e Launching an app while working on updates'`


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

`'Software Developer: Responsible for code generation and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Tests software to ensure it follows design and meets all requirement
Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.'`

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
`IDEs- are used for writing, debugging, and testing code while VCS  tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members `

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
`Scope Creep or Changing Requirement:
Tight Deadlines: 
Technical Debt: 
Communication can assist in managing expectations  and defining clear expectation. Tracking priotities and clear defifination of expectation`

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 `
-  Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
-  Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
-  System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
-  Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs`

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the act of crafting questions/statements for AI to get Responses. This Helps AI be clear and provide useful, straiht forward and 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
`generate an article about rainfall (vs) generate a 300 word article about the rainfall season in Nairobi. 
This provides a clear expectation and provides boundaries on what the AI needs to respond on.`
